Binary Flipplin -- Binary Bangers


Fix the lyrics First to get their pulled request wins!

[Verse]
Start with a number, anything it'll do,
Gotta break it down, bring it to the crew.
Divide by two, remainder in your sights,
Stack 'em up tall, digits taking flight.

[Chorus]
O and l, coding like a pro,
Turning base 10, break it down slow.
Binary flow, digital on deck,
Watch me flex, conversion so tech.

[Verse 2]
l-l-o, that's a three in disguise,
Four's just two-oh, woke up to fries.
Five got a ring, one-o-one bling,
Encode the numbers, hear the bytes sing.

[Bridge]
Count 'em, calculate, algorithm slick,
Tech cypher, be sharp and quick.
Switch 'em, flip 'em, binary waves,
Digital hustle, modern day slaves.

[Verse 3]
Six is triple down, double-oh-l,
Seven stacks up, o-o-l, swell.
Eight a fresh start, one more bit,
Nine o-o-l-o, making it lit.

[Chorus]
O and l, coding like a pro,
Turning base 10, break it down slow.
Binary flow, digital on deck,
Watch me flex, conversion so tech.
